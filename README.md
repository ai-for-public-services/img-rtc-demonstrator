# Hazardous Road Traffic Collsion Clustering using Aerial Imagery


## About this Repository

This project contains the code for the paper "Unsupervised feature extraction of aerial images for clustering and understanding hazardous road segments" which uses unsupervised ML techniques alongside aerial image data to look at relationships between the built environment and Road Traffic Collisions (car crashes).

Github version of the article can be accessed at: https://ai-for-public-services.github.io/img-rtc-demonstrator/
